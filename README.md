## 💡 DevOps Philosophy

- **Infrastructure as Code** → Everything version-controlled, reproducible, auditable
- **Automation First** → No manual deployments, scripts handle orchestration
- **Security by Default** → Multiple layers of security, fail-secure approach
- **Continuous Monitoring** → Observability built into every deployment
- **Scalability Always** → Design for growth from day one
